ðŸ˜´ AI FOR SLEEP DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING 


This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect and classify sleep states based on physiological or behavioral data. The objective is to build an intelligent system that can identify sleep patterns and stages, contributing to sleep monitoring, health tracking, and wellness analysis.

Project Overview:


Goal: Predict whether a person is asleep or awake using machine learning models trained on time-series or biometric data (e.g., heart rate, movement, EEG, etc.).

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

ML Techniques: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, classification algorithms (e.g., XG Boost and Random Forest)

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

Key Features:


End-to-end data pipeline: data ingestion, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation

Multiple supervised ML models for classification

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization


Deployed as an interactive app using Streamlit
