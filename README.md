Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

ML Techniques: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

📊 Key Features
End-to-end data pipeline: data ingestion, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation

Multiple supervised ML models for classification

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization

Model comparison and selection for optimal performance
